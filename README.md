# sql_learning
A collection of SQL queries and database scripts created while learning and practicing SQL on MySQL. This repository includes examples of creating tables, inserting data, writing SELECT queries with filtering, joining tables, aggregate functions, and data modification commands. 
This repo contains a collection of SQL queries and practice exercises from basic to advanced level. The purpose is to help anyone learn and improve their SQL skills step by step.

You will find queries for creating tables, inserting data, selecting with different conditions, updating, deleting, and also complex things like joins, subqueries, CTEs and window functions.

I wrote these queries while learning SQL myself and tried to keep them simple to understand. Also, some examples use real-life scenarios like students, employees, and courses so its easier to relate.

The exercises part helps you get hands-on experience by writing queries on given tasks. This is important to get confidence in using SQL for real work.

Feel free to use this repo as a learning guide or a quick reference. You can copy the queries and try them on your own SQL server or online playgrounds.

If you have any feedback or improvements, please do tell me.

Thanks for checking out my repo, and happy learning!
